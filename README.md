## 👋 Hi, I'm yamaga-shu

I'm a freelance web engineer based in Japan, working mainly with PHP (Laravel), JavaScript (Next.js), and Go.
With a strong focus on full-stack development, I help startups and small teams build web applications from the ground up — from prototyping to production.

- **Backend**: PHP (Laravel), Ruby (Rails), Go , Node.js
- **Database**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite

### 💼 Background
I started my career as a web developer in a small agency, then transitioned to freelancing to focus on projects that value both quality and flexibility.
I've worked on internal tools, membership systems, data visualization dashboards, and technical advisory for startups.

### 🔍 Interests
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Learning Rust and low-latency systems
- Private networking (e.g., WireGuard with Raspberry Pi)
- Kubernetes on cloud (cluster design, deployment, and monitoring)
