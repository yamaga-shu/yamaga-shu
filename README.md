## 👋 Hi, I'm yamaga-shu

I'm a freelance web engineer based in Japan, working mainly with PHP (Laravel), JavaScript (Next.js), and Go.
With a strong focus on full-stack development, I help startups and small teams build web applications from the ground up — from prototyping to production.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: PHP (Laravel), Go (Echo), Node.js
- **Database**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite
- **DevOps / Infra**: Docker, GitHub Actions
- **Others**: GraphQL, REST API, TDD, DDD, Clean Architecture

### 💼 Background
I started my career as a web developer in a small agency, then transitioned to freelancing to focus on projects that value both quality and flexibility.
I've worked on internal tools, membership systems, data visualization dashboards, and technical advisory for startups.

Currently, I'm supporting early-stage startups as a technical advisor — offering guidance on system design, architecture decisions, and local development environment setup.

### 🔍 Interests
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD) for small-scale systems
- Learning Rust and low-latency systems
- Private networking (e.g., WireGuard with Raspberry Pi)
- Building tools that help people understand their financial future
